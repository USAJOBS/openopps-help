title: What is Open Opportunities?
---
Open Opportunities is a government wide program offering professional development opportunities and facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing across the Federal Government.

## Professional development
Open Opportunities is for federal employees only and offers a wide variety of real world projects to work on.  

By participating you can:
* Sharpen your existing skills, or learn new ones.
* Break out of your routine—collaborate with other employees across different agencies.
* Work remotely or in-person—in fact 99.9% can be done remotely, so there are no travel costs.
* Choose from a wide range of projects across the government— some may take as little as 1-2 hours, while others may take 20% time over several months.

## Collaboration and knowledge sharing across the Federal Government
Opportunities offer an easy way for agencies, departments and other areas of the Federal Government to:

* Meet their mission, while offering professional development to fellow feds.
* Learn what other areas of the government are doing and share best practices.

## Connects the federal workforce
By posting an opportunity or working on one, Open Opportunities helps federal employees:

* Gain interagency insights and points of contact.
* Tap into the talent and expertise that’s often buried in agency silos.

## How does it work?
There are two ways you can participate.

### Post an opportunity 
You can create and post opportunities.  Get help on projects, propose working groups, get testers for new ideas or products or create a team to work on an idea you have.
[See how you can create an opportunity](../../opportunity/create/). 

### Work on an opportunity
You can apply to and work on opportunities that sound interesting.  Choose from a wide range of projects and discover something new. [Check out available opportunities](https://openopps.usajobs.gov/tasks)
