title: How long does it take to post an opportunity and review applicants?
---

It only takes a few minutes to create and post an opportunity. Before you get started, [read these tips on how to write a great opportunity](../getting-started/top-10-tips/).

How you review applicants is up to you. We encourage you to review each applicant profile and have a quick phone call or email exchange to see if they're the right person for the work.
