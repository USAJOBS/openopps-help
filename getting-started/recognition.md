title: Do I get recognition for participating in an opportunity?
---
If you work on and complete an opportunity, you will see a **Completed status** for that opportunity on your dashboard (when youâ€™re signed in). You will also see a link to download and print a **Certificate of Completion**. You may also receive a badge based on the number of opportunities you complete.
