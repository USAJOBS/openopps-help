title: Do I get recognition for participating in an opportunity or internship?
---

If you work on and complete an opportunity or internship, you will see a **Completed status** on your dashboard (when youâ€™re signed in). You will also see a link to download and print a **Certificate of Completion**. You may also receive a badge based on the number of opportunities or internships you complete.
