**This help content is for U.S. Department of State Internship (Unpaid) applicants**.

If you’re no longer interested in the U.S. Department of State Student Internship Program (Unpaid), you can withdraw your application.  

Another reason to withdraw your application is if you updated your USAJOBS profile AFTER you submitted your application. If you want to use the updated profile information in your application, you need to withdraw your existing application and create a new one to pull over your USAJOBS profile information. 

You can only withdraw your application while the application period is still open. 

To withdraw your application from the student internship program:

1. Sign into Open Opportunities.
2. Click on your name in the navigation—you will go to your landing page.
3. Look at the **Program** column and click the name of the application you want to withdraw—your application will open.
4. Click **Withdraw**—a message will appear to confirm you want to withdraw your application.
5. Click **Withdraw** again.

If you withdraw your application, you will lose all of the information in the application. If you decide you still want to apply, you will need to create a new application and go through the process again.

## Do you want to update your application?
Instead of withdrawing, you can update your application, however the changes you make to your application don’t get saved to your USAJOBS profile.
