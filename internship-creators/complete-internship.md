title: How to complete and close out an internship
---
To complete and close out an internship, you need to mark all of your participants as complete. Follow these steps:

1.	Sign into Open Opportunities and go to the **Created** section of your dashboard.
2.	Click the opportunity you want to complete and close.
3.	Click **Mark tasks complete** under each participant’s name who completed their work. The link label will change to **Tasks completed**.
4.	Click **Mark internship complete** after you’ve marked each participant as complete and the work is done.

The internship status on your dashboard will change to **Completed** and we’ll update your profile with your achievement. The participant’s status will also change to **Completed** and they may receive a badge on their profile.

## Complete the survey
Once you complete and close an opportunity, you’ll receive an email with a link to a survey about your experience. Please take time to complete the survey.
