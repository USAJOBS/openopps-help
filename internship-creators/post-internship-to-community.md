title: How to post to a community
---

A community is a group of Open Opportunity users who may belong to different agencies, but share a common goal or interest.

You can post an internship to a specific community. When you post to a community, the internship will appear on both the community search results and the main Open Opportunities search results. If you donâ€™t select a community, the internship will appear to all users.

To post an opportunity to a community:

1. Sign in to Open Opportunities.
2. Click **Create Opportunity** from the main search or landing page.
3. Click **Students** as a target audience.
4. Select **Yes** to post the internship to a specific community.
5. Select the community from the dropdown.
6. Follow the remaining steps to create the internship and submit.
