title: How to select an internship applicant
---

If you created and posted an internship, you’ll get an email every time someone applies to your internship. You can click the link in the email to see the internship and who has applied, or you can sign into Open Opportunities at any time to review applicants.

To review and select an applicant:

1. Sign into Open Opportunities—you’ll see your dashboard.
2. Go to the **Created** table.
3. Click on the internship you want to review.
4. Review the list of applicants located in the **Applicants** table.
5. Click the **View** icon under the **Full application** column for each applicant you want to review.
6. Review the applicants’ profile, skills, about me section and application (if applicable). You can also call or email the applicant to learn more about their skill set, interests or to get a better idea if they’re the right person for the work.
7. Go to the **Applicants** table and click **Select** or **Reject**. The applicants row will move to either the **Selected applicants** table or the **Rejected applicants** table.
8. Repeat these steps for each applicant you want to review.
9. Click **Complete applicant selection** once you’re done reviewing and selecting the applicants—we’ll send an automatic email to all applicants telling them whether or not they were selected.

Your internship is now **In Progress**!
