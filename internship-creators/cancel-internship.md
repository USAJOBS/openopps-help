title: How to cancel an internship
---
If you are an internship creator or a sitewide or community administrator, you can cancel an internship as long as it's not already complete. The status will change to **Canceled**, but you can reopen or duplicate it later. Canceled internships will also continue to appear on the creators' dashboard.

To cancel an internship:

1. Open the internship.
2. Scroll to the bottom right of the opportunity detail page.
3. Click **Cancel this internship**.
4. Click **Confirm**.

We will send an email to all applicants or participants letting them know the internship is canceled.
