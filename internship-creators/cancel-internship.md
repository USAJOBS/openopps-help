title: How to cancel an internship
---
If you are an opportunity creator or a sitewide or community administrator, you can cancel an opportunity as long as it's not already complete. The status will change to **Canceled**, but you can reopen or duplicate it later. Canceled opportunities will also continue to appear on the creators' dashboard.

To cancel an opportunity:

1. Open the opportunity.
2. Scroll to the bottom right of the opportunity detail page.
3. Click **Cancel this opportunity**.
4. Click **Confirm**.

We will send an email to all applicants or participants letting them know the opportunity is canceled.
