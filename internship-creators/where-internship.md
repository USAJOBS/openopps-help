title: What's the difference between a virtual and in-person internship?
---

## Participating in a virtual or in-person internship

A virtual internship means the work can be done remotely and you don’t need to travel. An in-person internship means you must do the work in-person at a specific location—usually the host office location. Some internships can be a combination of both.

## Creating a virtual or in-person internship

If you’re creating a new internship, you must select if the internship will be virtual, in-person, or both (you can select both options).

If you select virtual, you don’t need to provide additional information. If you select in-person or both options, you will need to include a location.
