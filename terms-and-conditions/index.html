<h1>Open Opportunities Terms of Use</h1>

<p>We don’t like lengthy and complicated Terms of Use, so here’s our attempt to make this simple and easy for you.</p>

<p>Here’s what we expect from you:</p>

<ul>
<li>You are a federal employee (sorry, our program limits us to feds only).</li>
<li>You’ve cleared your participation with your managers, and your agency expects no reimbursement or formal agreement.</li>
<li>You’ll complete your task as agreed from the outset to the best of your ability and make adjustments if you get feedback.</li>
<li>You’ll use the comment section on the task for posting your questions about that task.</li>
<li>You’ll maintain and uphold the good name and reputation of the program and your agency.</li>
<li>You will support the initiative and spread the word using your networks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s what you can expect from us:</p>

<ul>
<li>We’ll recognize and value your efforts, providing you with the best experience possible.</li>
<li>We’ll provide a wide range (different types and time commitments) of regularly updated opportunities–most that can be completed from anywhere.</li>
<li>We’ll make sure that the opportunities give an accurate estimate of effort because we respect your time.</li>
<li>We won’t ask for ongoing commitments or quotas, just work on the task(s) you want.</li>
<li>We’ll give you feedback on your work, but we reserve the right to ask for a rework or to repost the task.</li>
<li>We respect the confidentiality of any communications you have with us.</li>
<li>We value your feedback because otherwise we can’t make the program better.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="standards-of-conduct">Standards of Conduct</h2>

<p>We will review comments and questions that you post and use the following guidelines to review any content you provide.</p>

<p>Any material submitted may be removed if it includes any of the following:</p>

<li>Repetitive posts (for example, if you submit the same submission or comment multiple times on a single opportunity);</li>
<li>Spam or undecipherable language (gratuitous links will be viewed as spam);</li>
<li>Proprietary information that you do not hold the right to make public;</li>
