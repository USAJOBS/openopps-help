All participants must have their supervisor’s permission before they can work on an opportunity. Most participants are motivated individuals who are committed to the work.

Here are some tips to increase participation and commitment:

- Clearly state the time commitment and the work expectations in the opportunity details.
- Follow up with participants to make sure they have the time to complete the work.
- Set realistic deadlines and schedule regular check-ins.
- Communicate often and make sure you’re available for and responsive to their questions.
