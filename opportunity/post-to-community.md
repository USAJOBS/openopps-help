title: How to post to a community
---
A community is a group of Open Opportunity users who may belong to different agencies, but share a common goal or interest.

You can post an opportunity to a specific community.  When you post to a community, the opportunity will appear on both the community search results and the main Open Opportunities search results. If you donâ€™t select a community, the opportunity will appear to all users.

To post an opportunity to a community:

1. Click Create Opportunity from the main search or landing page.
2. Select the community from the **Community dropdown**.
3. Follow the remaining steps to create the opportunity and submit.
