## Share your expertise or best practices in a particular field

### Example 1. Industry Days

**Headline:**
Do you want to learn how to put together an Industry Day session?

**Introduction:**
You’ve heard about Industry Days, but have you ever participated in one?  Industry days benefit both the government and industry.  The government benefits by gaining knowledge of technology trends, new commercial products, and industry capabilities. Industry benefits by gaining a greater understanding of government requirements and the opportunity to better plan and make informed business decisions regarding participation. This communication between the government and industry can enhance competition, attract new businesses to the marketplace, and increase subcontracting opportunities.
                                                                                                                                         
**What you’ll do:** 
We’re looking for 1102s or CORs, with little to no experience with planning and executing an industry day session, to participate. If that’s you, we invite 2-3 participants to shadow our office as we go through this process.  We estimate it will require about 12 hours total, which will consist of four hours over the next three weeks. You can participate in person or remotely.   

### Example 2. Market Research

**What you’ll do:**
We have limited experience in conducting market research and are looking for someone to spend approximately three hours with our staff of five to help guide us in the most effective way to plan and organize our market research.
