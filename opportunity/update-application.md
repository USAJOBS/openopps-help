**This help content is for U.S. Department of State Student Internship Program (Unpaid) applicants**.

You can update a submitted application for the student internship program as long as the application period is open.  

There are two ways you can update your application once you’ve submitted it:

1. Update your application directly in Open Opportunities.
2. Update your USAJOBS profile and use your profile information to update your application.

## Update your application directly in Open Opportunities

If you update your application directly in Open Opportunities, any changes you make will NOT be saved into your USAJOBS profile.  While this may be the easiest way to update your application, it may require rework in the future (if you want to use the same application information).

To update your application in Open Opportunities for the student internship program:

1. Sign into Open Opportunities.
2. Click on your name in the navigation—you will go to your landing page.
3. Look at the **Program** column and click the name of the application you want to update—your application will open.
4. Click **Update**—a message will appear confirming you want to update your application and includes steps on how to update your application.
5. Click **Update application**.
6. Go to the page you want to edit by using the progress bar at the top of the page or by clicking the **Save and continue** button on each page. 
7. Click **Save and continue** once you make your change.
8. Click **Save and continue** on each page following the page you edited (you don’t have to **Save and continue** on any previous pages).
9. Review your application and click **Submit application**.

You must click **Submit application** to update your application. Any changes you make will NOT be saved into your USAJOBS profile. All updates must be submitted by 11:59 p.m. ET on the closing date. 

## Update your USAJOBS profile and use your profile information to update your application

If you update your USAJOBS profile information AFTER you submit your application, and you want to use your updated profile information, you need to withdraw your application and create a new one. Creating a new application will pull over your updated USAJOBS profile information.
