The application status tells you where your application is within the application process. The statuses are different based on whether you’ve applied to a federal employee opportunity or you’re student and have applied to an [internship opportunity](#application-status-for-student-internship-opportunities).

## Application status for federal employee opportunities

### Not assigned
You were not selected for the opportunity.

### Complete

## Application status for student internship opportunities
