title: How to search for an opportunity?
---

You can search for opportunities by keyword or filters.
## Search by keyword
Use the keyword search box to enter an opportunity name, agency, skill, series or other keywords. The keyword search box is located at the top of the page or you can click the search icon located in the upper right corner.

## Search by filters
### Status
Every opportunity has a status, depending on where it is in the process. You can search for and filter opportunities by one of the following statuses.

#### Open
An opportunity that’s “open” is accepting applicants. The work has not yet started and you can apply to any “open” opportunity.

#### In progress
An opportunity that’s “in progress” has already started.  Participants have been assigned and are working on the opportunity.  You can’t apply to an opportunity that’s “in progress”. 

#### Completed
An opportunity that’s “completed” is done.  The work has been completed and you can no longer apply to the opportunity.

### Skill
You can search for opportunities by the type of skills you have or are looking to gain. Examples are graphic design, writing, photography or data visualization. You can enter as many skills as you’d like and the search results will update based on what you enter. 

### Career field
You can search for opportunities by career field.  Select a career field from the pre-populated drop down list.  

### Series
Jobs in the Federal Government are categorized into “series” – a family of similar occupations. You can search for opportunities that fall within a specific series. For example, if you want an opportunity that falls under information technology, you can search by 2200. [See the list of all job series](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/classifying-general-schedule-positions/#url=Standards).

### Time commitment
You can search for opportunities by how much time you have or are willing to commit to. Some opportunities may take as little as 1-2 hours, while others may take 20% time over several months. 

#### One-time
This is an opportunity that requires a single commitment. There is a clearly defined deliverable and you can expect to complete it within a set amount of hours. 

#### Ongoing
This is an opportunity where the work will take a longer period of time and requires you to work several hours per week (usually 8 hours) over several months.

#### Full-time detail
This is a temporary assignment to a different position for a specified period. You are expected to return to your regular duties at the end of the assignment.  Your agency will need to complete paperwork for you to work on a full-time detail opportunity. 

### Location

#### Virtual
A virtual opportunity means you can work from wherever you want. Most of your work and communication with other participants will be online. About 99% of all opportunities are virtual.

#### In person
An in-person opportunity requires you to be physically present to do the work.
