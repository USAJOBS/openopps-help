title: How to participate in an opportunity
---
Participating in an opportunity is a great way to gain experience, contribute your expertise and work with others across the Federal Government.

To participate, you need to [create an account](../../account/) and fill out your profile, including your skills, interests and a short bio. And, you also need to ask your supervisor to make sure it’s okay for you to participate.

Once you have an account, you can apply to any open opportunity.  

1. Click **Search opportunities** and enter a keyword into the search box to search for opportunities that interest you.
2. Use the search filters to narrow your results by status, skill, career field, time commitment and more.
3. Read the opportunity details to learn what skills are needed, how much time is involved and to see if it’s a good match for you.
4. Click **Apply** if you’re interested in an opportunity.

## What happens after I apply?
The person who posted the opportunity will review your profile and reach out to you via email to see if you’re a good match for the work. They may even set up a time to talk.

Once a selection is made, you’ll get an email letting you know if you’re selected and all the details you’ll need to get started.  We’ll also mark the opportunity as ‘assigned’, so it will no longer appear as ‘open’ and accepting applicants.

If you’re not selected, you’ll get an email notifying you.  Don’t give up—there are plenty of other opportunities available.  

Feel free to post questions in the comments section at the bottom of the opportunity or you can reach out to us as OpenOpps@usajobs.gov.
