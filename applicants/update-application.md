4. Find the detail or lateral you want to update and click the link—you’ll go to the opportunity detail page.

### Update your USAJOBS profile and use your profile information to update your application

If you update your USAJOBS profile information AFTER you submit your application, and you want to use your updated profile information, you need to withdraw your application and create a new one. Creating a new application will pull over your updated USAJOBS profile information.
