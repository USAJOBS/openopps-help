---

You can search for opportunities by keyword or filters.

## Search by keyword

Use the keyword search box to enter an opportunity name, skill, other keywords. The keyword search box is located at the top of the page or you can click the search icon located in the upper right corner.

## Search by filters

### Skill

You can search for opportunities by the type of skills you have or are looking to gain. Examples are graphic design, writing, photography or data visualization. You can enter as many skills as you’d like and the search results will update based on what you enter.

## Filters for federal employees

### Status

Every opportunity has a status, depending on where it is in the process. You can search for and filter opportunities by one of the following statuses.

#### Open

An opportunity that’s “open” is accepting applicants. The work has not yet started and you can apply to any “open” opportunity.

#### In progress

An opportunity that’s “in progress” has already started. Participants have been assigned and are working on the opportunity. You can’t apply to an opportunity that’s “in progress”.

### Profile match

We use Skills Engine ™ to analyze the skills you list in your profile and the skills needed for an opportunity. We will highlight opportunities based on how well your skills match. The matching can range from **Good** to **Better** to **Best**. 

You can apply to any opportunity, even ones that don’t show as a match, and the opportunity creator will not know if you match the opportunity. Use the profile match as a guideline to understand which opportunities might be a good fit for your skills. 

### Community

You can search for opportunities specific to a community. These opportunities typically share a common goal or interest, such as acquisitions or cyber.

### Career field

You can search for opportunities by career field. Select a career field from the pre-populated drop down list.

### Series

Jobs in the federal government are categorized into “series” – a family of similar occupations. You can search for opportunities that fall within a specific occupational series. For example, if you want an opportunity that falls under information technology, you can search by 2200. [See the list of all occupational series](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/classification-qualifications/classifying-general-schedule-positions/#url=Standards){:target="_blank"}.

### Time commitment

You can search for opportunities by how much time you have or are willing to commit to. Some opportunities may take as little as 1-2 hours, while others may take 20% time over several months.

#### One-time

This is an opportunity that requires a single commitment. There is a clearly defined deliverable and you can expect to complete it within a set amount of hours.

#### Recurring

This is an opportunity where the work will take a longer period of time and requires you to work several hours per week (usually 8 hours) over several months.

#### Detail

A detail is a temporary assignment to a different position for a specified period. You are expected to return to your regular duties at the end of the assignment. Your agency will need to complete paperwork for you to work on a full-time detail opportunity. You can search for full-time or part-time details, as well as by pay scale and grade.

### Location

#### Virtual

A virtual opportunity means you can work from wherever you want. Most of your work and communication with other participants will be online. About 99% of all opportunities are virtual.

#### In person

An in-person opportunity requires you to be physically present to do the work. If you select this filter, you can also search by a specific city and state.
