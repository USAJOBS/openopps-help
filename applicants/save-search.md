title: How to save a search
---

You can save a search to help you look for opportunities that interest you. When you save a search, we’ll look for opportunities that match the keywords and other criteria in your search and email you when an opportunity matches your search.

- You can create and save up to 10 saved searches—a saved search will **expire one year after you create it**.
- You can sign up to receive email notifications when an opportunity matches your search.
- You can manage your saved searches in your profile.

## To save a search and sign up for email notifications

Sign into Open Opportunities. If you don’t have a profile, you need to create one. Only signed in users can save their search.

1. Start a search by entering a keyword or location in the search box and click **Search**.
2. Narrow your results using filters.
3. Click **Save this search** on the search results page located above the search results.
4. Name your search—this will help you manage your saved searches.
5. Click **Save**.

## Manage saved searches in your profile

You can manage your saved searches in the Saved searches section of your profile. You can have both active and archived saved searches.

1. Sign into Open Opportunities and go to **Saved searches**, located on your Home page.
2. Click the **+** next to a saved search to see more details.

From here you can:

### Run your saved search

Click **View results** to run the saved search and see your results.

### Renew a search

Saved searches expire after one year and will automatically move into your archived list. Click **Renew** to renew your search for an additional year.

### Edit your saved search

Click **Edit** to change your keywords, location or filters. You’ll have the option to save the updated search.

### Sign up for email notifications

Select the **Email notifications** checkbox to receive an email notification when new opportunities that match your search are available.

### Delete your saved search

You can only delete saved searches from your archived list.

1. Go to your **Archived saved searches** and click the **+** next to the saved search you want to delete.
2. Click **Delete** located under the **Unarchive** search button.

If you delete a saved search, we’ll remove it from your profile.

### Archive your saved search

Click **Archive** to move the saved search to your archived list. You may want to archive a saved search if you’re no longer interested in the search, but you don’t want to delete it.
