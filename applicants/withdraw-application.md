### How to use updated profile information in an application

Another reason to withdraw your application is if you updated your USAJOBS profile AFTER you submitted your application. If you want to use the updated profile information in your application, you need to withdraw your existing application and create a new one to pull over your USAJOBS profile information.

### Do you want to update your application?

Instead of withdrawing, you can update your application, however the changes you make to your application donâ€™t get saved to your USAJOBS profile.
