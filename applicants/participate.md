title: How to apply to an opportunity or internship
---

Applying to and participating in an <a href="#How_to_appy_to_an_opportunity">opportunity</a> or <a href="#How_to_apply_to_an_internship">internship</a> is a great way to gain experience, contribute your expertise and work with others across the federal government.

You must be a current federal employee to apply to an opportunity. If you’re a student, you can apply to Virtual Student Federal Service internships. To apply to either, you need to [create a profile](../profile). Your profile highlights your skills, education, experience and areas of interest, such as career areas, agencies you’re interested in and other topics. If you're a federal employee, you also need your supervisor's permission to apply and participate.

### How do I apply to a detail or lateral?

To apply to a detail or lateral opportunity, follow the same steps above. After you click **Apply**, you’ll need to enter a statement of interest and submit a resume. You can select a resume you've already created or uploaded on USAJOBS or you can upload a new resume.

### What happens after I apply?

The person who posted the opportunity will review your profile or application (if you applied to a detail or lateral) and reach out to you by email to see if you’re a good match for the work. They may even set up a time to talk.

### How do I know if I’m selected?

You’ll get an email letting you know if you’re selected. The email will include all the details you’ll need to get started. We’ll also mark the opportunity as "In progress", so it will no longer appear as open and accepting applicants.

You’ll also get an email if you’re not selected. Don’t give up—there are plenty of other opportunities available.

### Who can I contact if I have questions?

Feel free to post questions in the comments section at the bottom of the opportunity detail page or [contact us using this form](https://openopps.usajobs.gov/contact).
