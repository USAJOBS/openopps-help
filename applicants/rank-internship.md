To rank internships:

2. Go to the **Rank your recent internships** section of your dashboard.
3. Select the community and cycle the internship you applied to is a part of. 
4. Click the up and down arrows in the **Adjust ranking** column to change the rank of your internship applications. 

### Why should I rank the internships? 

Internship creators and co-owners will use your ranking to better understand your interest in the internship.
