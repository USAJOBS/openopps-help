3. Scroll to the **Skills & mentorship** tile and click **Edit** or **Add** if you haven't listed any skills yet.
4. Complete the **I have experience with** or the **I want to develop** text box, depending on whether you want to be a mentor or find a mentor.
5. Select the box(es) for **Willing to mentor** or **Looking for a mentor**&mdash;you can be both.
6. Click **Save**.
