If you're an opportunity creator, you can endorse a participant once they've completed their work and you've marked their task as complete.
1. Sign into Open Opportunities
2. Go to your opportunity.
3. Go to Selected applicants and find the participant who has finished their task and you want to endorse.
4. Click **Task complete**&mdash;a pop up modal will appear asking if you want to endorse the participant.
5. Select **Yes** and enter an endorsement in the text box. Select **No** if you don't want to leave an endorsement.
6. Click **Complete**.

The participant will receive an email that they have an endorsement.
