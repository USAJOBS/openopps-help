Community Managers (CMs) determine the goals and objectives of their community.
CMs work with other members of their community and the Open Opportunities team to promote and realize the full potential of their community.

If you're a Community Manager, download and use our interactive Community Manager Playbook to help you:

* Understand the Community Manager role.
* Establish goals and directions for your community.
* Put your community on a path towards sustained success.
