title: How to add a discussion board to your community
---

You must be an administrator to add a discussion board to your community. You also need to set up your community profile page before you can add a discussion board.

1. Sign in to Open Opportunities.
2. Go to your administration dashboard.
3. Select the **Community** tab and click **Settings**.
4. Make sure the community profile page is set up. You can only add a discussion board if the community has a profile page.
5. Go to the **Community discussion board** section.
6. Toggle on the **Display community discussion board** option and fill out the required information.
7. Click **Save changes**.

Your **Community discussion board** is now live, and is available on your community profile page.
