title: What is a community?
---

A community is a group of people with shared interests, values, behaviors, and artifacts. There are communities for:

* Federal agencies
* Career fields
* Specific areas of interest

There are open and closed communities. Anyone can join an open community. However, you need to request to join a closed community.

## To find and join a community

1. Sign in to Open Opportunities.
2. Click **Communities** in the navigation to see a list of all available communities.
4. Click any community to view its profile page.
5. Click **Join community**&mdash;this will only appear if the community is open to anyone.

Once you join a community, you will have access to their opportunities and discussion board.

If you would like to create a community in Open Opportunities, email us at <OpenOpps@usajobs.gov>.
