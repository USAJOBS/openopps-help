title: How to delete an opportunity
---
If you're a sitewide or community administrator, you can delete opportunities that are in draft or submitted status. You can’t delete an opportunity that is open or in progress. If you want to remove an opportunity that is open or in progress, you need to cancel the opportunity.

To delete an opportunity:

1.	Sign into Open Opportunities.
2.	Go to the **Administration** section of your dashboard.
3.	Click **Manage** next to opportunities.
4.	Select the **Draft** or **Submitted** status.
5.	Go to the opportunity you want to delete.
6.	Click the red x in the **Delete** column—you’ll see a confirmation message.
7.	Click **Delete**.
8.	Repeat these steps for each opportunity you want to delete.
