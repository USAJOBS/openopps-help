title: How to delete a participant from an opportunity
---

If you’re a sitewide or community administrator, you can delete a participant from an opportunity as long as the opportunity is open, or in progress.

To delete a participant:

1.	Sign into Open Opportunities.
2.	Click **Administration**—you’ll go to your dashboard.
3.	Go to the **Sitewide**, **Agency** or **Community** tab. Depending on your role, you’ll only see tab options that you’re an administrator for. If you are a community manager, you will only see the **Community** tab.
4.	Click **Manage Opportunities** in the sub-navigation.
5.	Select the **Open** or **In progress** status.
6.	Find the opportunity with the participant you want to delete.
7.	Click the **Delete applicant/participant** icon.
8.	Click the **red x** next to the participant you want to delete.
9.	Enter the reason for deleting the participant.
10.	Click **Delete**.
