As a sitewide or community manager, you can assign existing community members as community managers.  Community managers can view the community administrator dashboard, as well as view and approve opportunities.

To make an existing member a community manager:
1.	Sign in to Open Opportunities.
2.	Click **Administration** and you'll go to your dashboard.
3.	Click the **Community** tab and make sure you have the correct Community.
4.	Click **Manage Users** in the sub navigation.
5.	Find the member you want to make a community manager.
6.	Click the **Community admin** toggleâ€”it will turn green and this will assign the role of community manager.
