1.	Sign in to Open Opportunities.
2.	Click on **Administration** and then **Community**.
3.	Select the community that you want to add a member.
4.	Click **Manage** next to **Members**.
5.	Find the member you want to make a community manager.
6.	Click the **Community admin** toggleâ€”it will turn green and this will assign the role of community manager.
