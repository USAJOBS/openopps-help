title: What do the interaction metrics mean?
---
Interaction metrics give insight into how applicants are using Open Opportunities. If youâ€™re a sitewide, agency or community administrator, you can view and manage the interaction metrics within the **Administration** dashboard. 

Sitewide metrics show metrics for all users of Open Opportunities. Agency metrics show metrics for users within a specific agency.  Community metrics show metrics for members of a specific community.

## Total applications
The total number of applications submitted for all opportunities. This is not the number of unique applicants. For example, if one user applies to four opportunities, they will count as four applications.

## Total selected
The total number of applicants who were assigned as a participant to an opportunity. 

## Total completed
The total number of participants who were marked as **Task completed** meaning they completed the work on their opportunity.

## Discussion posts
The total number of comments and replies to comments for all opportunities.
