title: How to add a participant to an opportunity
---
If you’re a sitewide or community administrator, you can add a participant to a one-time opportunity as long as the opportunity is open, not open, or in progress.
You can’t add a participant to a detail or lateral, because those opportunities require a resume and statement of interest to apply.

To add a participant:

1.	Sign in to Open Opportunities.
2.	Go to the **Administration** section on your dashboard.
3.	Click the **Sitewide**, **Agency** or **Community** tab. Depending on your role, you’ll only have tab options that you’re an administrator for. If you are a community manager, you will only have the **Community** tab.
4.	Click **Manage Opportunties** in the sub-navigation.
5.	Select the **Open**, **Not open**, or **In progress** status to find the opportunity you want to update.
6.	Click the **Add participant** icon.
7.	Type the person's name until you see it in the list—they must have an Open Opportunities account.
8.	Select the person's name and click **Add applicant**.
