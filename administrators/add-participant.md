title: How to add a participant to an opportunity
---
If you’re a sitewide or community administrator, you can add a participant to a one-time opportunity. You can add a participant as long as the opportunity is open, not open, or in progress.
You can’t add a participant to a detail or lateral, because those opportunities require a resume and statement of interest to apply.

To add a participant:

1.	Sign into Open Opportunities.
2.	Click **Administration**—you’ll go to your dashboard.
3.	Click the **Sitewide**, **Agency** or **Community** tab. Depending on your role, you’ll only see tab options that you’re an administrator for. If you are a community manager, you will only see the **Community** tab.
4.	Click **Manage Opportunties** in the sub-navigation.
5.	Select the **Open**, **Not open**, or **In progress** status.
6.	Find the one-time or recurring opportunity you want to add a participant.
7.	Click the **Add participant** icon.
8.	Type the person's name until you see it in the list—they must have an Open Opportunities account.
9.	Select the person's name and click **Add applicant**.
