title: How to add a participant to an opportunity
---
If you’re a sitewide or community administrator, you can add a participant to a one-time or recurring opportunity. You can add a participant as long as the opportunity is open, not open, or in progress.
You can’t add a participant to a detail or lateral, because those opportunities require a resume and statement of interest to apply.

To add a participant:

1.	Sign into Open Opportunities.
2.	Go to the **Administration** section of your dashboard.
3.	Click **Manage** next to opportunities.
4.	Select the **Open**, **Not open**, or **In progress** status.
5.	Find the one-time or recurring opportunity you want to add a participant.
6.	Click the **Add participant** icon.
7.	Type the person's name until you see it in the list—they must have an Open Opportunities account.
8.	Select the person's name and click **Add applicant**.
