title: How to change the owner of an opportunity
---
If you’re a sitewide, agency, or community manager, you can change the owner of an opportunity. You might need to change the owner if the current owner has left your agency and the opportunity needs to stay open or in progress.  The new owner must be in your agency.

To change an owner:

1.	Sign into Open Opportunities.
2.	Go to the **Administration** section of your dashboard.
3.	Click **Manage** next to opportunities.
4.	Select the **Open**, **Not open**, or **In progress** status.
5.	Find the opportunity where you need to change the owner.
6.	Click the **Change owner icon**.
7.	Type the new owner’s name until you see it in the list—they must have an Open Opportunities account and they must be in your agency.
8.	Select the new owner’s name and click **Change owner**.
