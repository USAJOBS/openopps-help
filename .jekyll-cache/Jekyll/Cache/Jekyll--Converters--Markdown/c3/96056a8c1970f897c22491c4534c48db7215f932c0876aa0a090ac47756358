<p>A virtual opportunity means the work can be done remotely and you donâ€™t need to travel. An in-person opportunity means you must do the work in-person at a specific locationâ€”usually the host office location. Some opportunities can be a combination of both.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re creating a new opportunity, you must select if the opportunity will be virtual, in-person, or both (you can select both options).</p>

<p>If you select virtual, you donâ€™t need to provide additional information. If you select in-person or both options, you will need to include a location.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re creating a <strong>detail opportunity</strong> and you select in-person, you will need to include a location and <strong>answer if the host office will pay for travel</strong>â€”either yes, no, or negotiable. If you choose â€˜negotiableâ€™, the host office needs to work with the participantâ€™s home office to agree on the travel pay.</p>
