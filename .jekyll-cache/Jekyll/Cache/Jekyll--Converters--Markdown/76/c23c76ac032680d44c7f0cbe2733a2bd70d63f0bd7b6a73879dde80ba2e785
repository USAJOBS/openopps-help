I"û<p>There are two ways you can participate in Open Opportunities.</p>

<h2 id="post-an-opportunity">Post an opportunity</h2>

<p>Any federal employee can create and post an opportunity. Some federal contractors can post opportunities on behalf of their federal manager, <strong>but they canâ€™t apply to or work on an opportunity</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="work-on-an-opportunity">Work on an opportunity</h2>

<p>Current federal employees can apply to and work on opportunities. <strong>If youâ€™re a student</strong> you can apply to internship opportunities.</p>

<h2 id="do-i-need-approval-to-participate">Do I need approval to participate?</h2>

<p>Yes. You must have your supervisorâ€™s permission to participate in an opportunity, whether itâ€™s posting an opportunity or applying to one. You must confirm you have your supervisorâ€™s permission during the application process.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-participate-in-an-opportunity-during-my-own-time">Can I participate in an opportunity during my own time?</h2>

<p>No. You can only work on an opportunity during your regular work hours. Working on your own time makes you â€œvoluntaryâ€ and â€œunless otherwise authorized by law, an agency may not accept the voluntary services of an employee.â€ (See 31 U.S.C. 1342.â€)</p>
