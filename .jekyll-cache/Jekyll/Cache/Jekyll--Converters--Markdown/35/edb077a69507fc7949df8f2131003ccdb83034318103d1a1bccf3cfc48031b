I"x<p>Current federal employees, and some federal contractors, can create and post opportunities. You can post opportunities to get help on projects, propose working groups, get testers for new ideas or products or create a team to work on an idea you have.</p>

<h3 id="before-you-get-started">Before you get started</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Ask your supervisor if it’s okay to post an opportunity—you need their approval.</li>
  <li>Read our <a href="../getting-started/top-10-tips/">tips for writing a great opportunity announcement</a> and <a href="sample-opportunities">check out a few examples</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="../profile/">Create a profile</a> if you don’t already have one—you must have a profile to create and post an opportunity.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="create-your-opportunity">Create your opportunity</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Sign into Open Opportunities and click <strong>Create opportunity</strong>.</li>
  <li>Select the target audience for the opportunity and click <strong>Continue</strong>—the default option is Federal Employees.</li>
  <li>Select a <strong>community</strong> if you want to post to a specific community. <strong>Skip this step if you’re not posting to a community</strong>. A community is a group of Open Opportunity users who may belong to different agencies, but share a common goal or interest.</li>

  <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong> when you’re ready to post the opportunity. Or, click <strong>Save for later</strong> if you’re not ready to post—we’ll save it as a draft in your profile.</li>
  <li>The administrators will review your opportunity after your click <strong>Submit</strong>. They’ll send you an email when it’s approved and goes live. Or, email you if you need to make changes.</li>
