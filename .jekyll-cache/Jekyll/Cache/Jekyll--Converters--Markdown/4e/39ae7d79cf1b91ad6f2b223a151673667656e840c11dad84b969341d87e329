I"ÿ	<p>The commitment varies for each opportunity. Some opportunities are a â€˜one-timeâ€™ deal, while others require a longer commitment.</p>

<h2 id="one-time">One-time</h2>

<p>A one-time opportunity will happen only once. For example, helping with a specific meeting, writing a paper, or creating a piece of marketing collateral. You stay in your current job and there is no money exchanged.</p>

<h2 id="recurring">Recurring</h2>

<p>A recurring opportunity happens on a recurring basis. For example, writing a monthly newsletter or participating in a monthly focus group. You stay in your current job and there is no money exchanged.</p>

<h2 id="detail">Detail</h2>

<p>Detail opportunities can be part-time or full-time, and limited to a certain number of days. You work for someone else for an extended period of time.</p>

<p>A <strong>part-time detail</strong> lets you stay in your current job while taking on another job part-time. A <strong>full-time detail</strong> requires you to leave your current job and take on another job for a period of time.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re creating a detail opportunity you must include instructions on how to apply and any additional requirements.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-it-mean-if-a-detail-is-reimbursable">What does it mean if a detail is reimbursable?</h3>

<p>Some detail opportunities are reimbursable, meaning the host office (the place where a participant will perform the work) will pay the home office (the place where a participant is employed) for the participantsâ€™ time.</p>

<p>If a detail opportunity is not reimbursable, then the host office does not pay the home office. The home office will continue to pay the participant as they normally do (even while they are on the detail with the host office).</p>

<p>If the reimbursement is negotiable, the home and host offices must agree on payment.</p>

<h2 id="lateral">Lateral</h2>

<p>A lateral is a permanent move to a new position <strong>in your current agency</strong>, where you move to a new position at the same grade level as your previous position. Laterals offer a chance to gain new skills to help you move up in your career, or a chance to bring someone on that has skills they arenâ€™t using into a new job where they could use the skills.</p>

<p>In Open Opportunities, laterals are <strong>only available within an agency community</strong> and you canâ€™t apply to a lateral outside of your agency.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re creating a lateral opportunity you must include instructions on how to apply and any additional requirements.</p>
