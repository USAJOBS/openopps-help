I"ú<p>To participate in Open Opportunities, you must have a profile and be a current federal employee or student.  Some federal contractors can also access Open Opportunities to post opportunities, but they canâ€™t apply to or work on an opportunity.</p>

<p>With a profile, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highlight your skills, experience and what youâ€™re interested in.</li>
  <li>Post opportunities.</li>
  <li>Apply to opportunities.</li>
  <li>Manage your opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Youâ€™ll also have the benefits of a USAJOBS profile, because Open Opportunities and USAJOBS now share one profile across both sites.</p>

<p>There are three steps to creating an Open Opportunities profile.</p>

<h2 id="1-create-a-logingov-account">1. Create a login.gov account</h2>
<p>You need a login.gov account to sign into Open Opportunities. You only need to create a login.gov account once. Once you create a login.gov account, you can use the same email address and password for both Open Opportunities and USAJOBS. If youâ€™ve already created a login.gov account for USAJOBS, you donâ€™t need to create another one.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a login.gov accountâ€”you only need to do this once.</li>
  <li>Enter an email address - use the same email address you use for USAJOBS. If you donâ€™t have a USAJOBS profile, enter a personal email address.</li>
  <li>Create a new password.</li>
  <li>Have a working phone number (mobile or landline) or an authentication application installed on a deviceâ€”login.gov will send you a one-time security code.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://openopps.usajobs.gov/login">Create your login.gov account</a>.</p>

<p><a href="login-gov">What is login.gov</a>?</p>

<h2 id="2-create-or-link-your-usajobs-profile">2. Create or link your USAJOBS profile</h2>
<p>Once you create a login.gov account, youâ€™ll go to USAJOBS to link to your existing profile, or create a new one.</p>

<p>You need a USAJOBS profile because Open Opportunities is now a part of USAJOBS and youâ€™ll share one profile across the two sites. If you donâ€™t have a USAJOBS profile, weâ€™ll help you create one.</p>

<p>In your USAJOBS profile, make sure you:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select <strong>Federal Employee</strong> or <strong>Student</strong> as a hiring path. If youâ€™re a federal contractor, select the hiring path that fits you.</li>
  <li>Update the <strong>Federal Service Experience</strong> section of your profile, if youâ€™re a federal employee or contractor.</li>
</ol>

<p>If youâ€™re a federal employee:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select your <strong>Department &amp; agency</strong>.</li>
  <li>Add your <strong>Federal Government email address</strong>.</li>
  <li>Confirm your federal email addressâ€”look for the confirmation email in your inbox.</li>
  <li>Fill out your <strong>Biography</strong>â€”this helps other Open Opps users get to know you and managers use it to decide if youâ€™re the right fit for the opportunitiy.</li>
</ul>

<p>If youâ€™re a federal contractor:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select <strong>I am a current contractor working for the Federal Government</strong> in the <strong>Federal Service Experience</strong> section.</li>
  <li>Select the <strong>Department &amp; agency</strong> youâ€™re currently working for.</li>
  <li>Add your federal email address.</li>
  <li>Confirm your federal email addressâ€”look for the confirmation email in your inbox.</li>
  <li>Fill out your <strong>Biography</strong>â€”this helps other Open Opps users get to know you and managers use it to decide if youâ€™re the right fit for the opportunitiy.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-complete-or-link-your-open-opportunities-profile">3. Complete or link your Open Opportunities profile</h2>
<p>Once youâ€™ve created your login.gov account and USAJOBS profile, weâ€™ll link them to your existing Open Opportunities profile. If you donâ€™t have an Open Opportunities profile, weâ€™ll help you complete the final steps of adding skills and a photo.</p>

<p>Your profile highlights your skills, experience and areas of interest, such as career areas, agencies youâ€™re interested in and other topics.  We encourage you to review your information and fill in anything thatâ€™s missing.</p>

<h2 id="why-should-i-complete-my-profile">Why should I complete my profile?</h2>
<p>Having a complete profile is important because this is what opportunity creators will look at first, if you apply to their opportunity. Also, now that Open Opportunities and USAJOBS share one profile, having a complete one will help you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Connect with others who share similar interests and skills.</li>
  <li>House and manage your contact information, experience, education and documents, all in one place.</li>
  <li>Get access to future features such as recommended jobs and learning opportunities.</li>
  <li>Have one place to aggregate your learning experiences.</li>
</ul>
