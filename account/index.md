To participate in Open Opportunities, you first must create an account.  With an account, you can:

* Edit your profile to highlight your skills, experience and what you’re interested in.
* Post opportunities.
* Apply to opportunities.
* Manage your opportunities.

To create an account:

1. Click **Sign In**—you’ll come to the sign in page.
2. Scroll down and click **Create a new account**.
3. Fill out all the information, create a password and verify you’re a federal employee.
4. Click **Create account** and you’ll go to the Open Opportunities dashboard.

## Edit your profile

Once you’ve created your account, you need to edit and complete your profile.  Your profile highlights your skills, experience and areas of interest, such as career areas, agencies you’re interested in and other topics.

Your profile is important because this is what opportunity creators will look at first, if you apply to their opportunity. A complete profile will also help you connect with others who share similar interests and skills.
