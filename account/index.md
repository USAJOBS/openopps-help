To participate in Open Opportunities, you must have a profile.

With a profile, you can:

- Highlight your skills, experience and what you’re interested in.
- Post opportunities.
- Apply to opportunities.
- Manage your opportunities.

You’ll also have the benefits of a USAJOBS profile, because Open Opportunities and USAJOBS now share one profile across both sites.

There are three steps to creating an Open Opportunities profile.

## 1. Create a login.gov account
You need a login.gov account to sign into Open Opportunities. You only need to create a login.gov account once. Once you create a login.gov account, you can use the same email address and password for both Open Opportunities and USAJOBS.

1. Create a login.gov account—you only need to do this once.
2. Enter an email address - use the same email address you use for USAJOBS. If you don’t have a USAJOBS profile, enter a personal email address.
3. Create a new password.
4. Have a working phone number (mobile or landline) or an authentication application installed on a device—login.gov will send you a one-time security code.

## 2. Create or link your USAJOBS profile
Once you create a login.gov account, you’ll go to USAJOBS to link to your existing profile, or create a new one.

You need a USAJOBS profile because Open Opportunities is now a part of USAJOBS and you’ll share one profile across the two sites. If you don’t have a USAJOBS profile, we’ll help you create one.

## 3. Complete or link your Open Opportunities profile
Once you’ve created your login.gov account and USAJOBS profile, we’ll help you create an Open Opportunities profile, or link to an existing one.

Your profile highlights your skills, experience and areas of interest, such as career areas, agencies you’re interested in and other topics.  We encourage you to review your information and fill in anything that’s missing.

## Why should I complete my profile?
Having a complete profile is important because this is what opportunity creators will look at first, if you apply to their opportunity. A complete profile will also help you connect with others who share similar interests and skills.
