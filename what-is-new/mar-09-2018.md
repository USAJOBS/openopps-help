### New design
We updated the site to use the USAJOBS design system. This includes updates to the color, typography, button style, layout and more.

### Enhancements
We added:

* The ability to assign participants to an opportunity, while keeping the opportunity open.
* Labels to indicate where the opportunity is in the process--whether it's assigning, in progress or completed.
* The ability to mark participants with 'task completed'.
* An automatic notification to the opportunity creator when a new comment is added to an opportunity.
* An option to cancel an opportunity.
* An agency admin role.
* A way to clearly identify which applicants have been assigned to an opportunity.
* An easy way to mark the entire opportunity as complete.

### Bug fixes
We fixed:

* The image displays in IE and Edge.
* The email field for signing in—it’s no longer case sensitive.

### Security updates

* We're now using a non-persistent cookie.
* Added an inactive session termination
* Limited the visibility of unauthenticated users.
* Fixed the password confirmation on password reset.
