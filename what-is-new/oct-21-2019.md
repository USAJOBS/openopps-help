### Enhancements

* Added new sorting and filtering options to the administrator dashboard to help administrators find user and opportunity or internship information.
* Added a "Not completed" status for internship applications. A user will see the "Not completed" status if their application was in progress, but they did not submit it before the cycle closed.
