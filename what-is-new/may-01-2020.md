### Site-wide enhancements

* Updated the opportunity card to display a community logo, as well as the opportunity creator name.
* Added a link to the help center for the Who section of the **Create Opportunity** page.
* Hid applicant photos on the review page for **Details** and **Laterals**.
* Added functionality so opportunity creators can mark applicants as accepted or not accepted. 
* Updated the community description field to include line breaks and a clickable link.
* Updated the search function so a user can search by clicking on a skill tag.
* Added functionality to disable a community so a community manager can remove inactive communities from displaying. Community managers can still view disabled communities and can request to reactivate if needed.
* Added notifications for when a community is disabled, so users understand why they can no longer see a community.
* Added the ability to create customer banners on the landing page and search page for important notices.
