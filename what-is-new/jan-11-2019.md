  * Added a community administrator role - community administrators will get an email when there are opportunities ready for them to review and approve.
  * Community administrators can add members to a community—members will get an email when they’re added to a community.
* Added a step to the Create an opportunity process to select a target audience — you can post an opportunity to a specific audience (community, agency, all Federal Employees, etc.)
* Imported data from USAJOBS to standardize our information.
