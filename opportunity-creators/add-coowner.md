title: How to add a co-owner to an opportunity
---

If you’re a primary owner of an opportunity, you can add a co-owner to help share the work. A co-owner can edit the opportunity details and review and select applicants.

To add a co-owner:

1.	Sign into Open Opportunities.
2.	Open your opportunity—look for the **Co-owner** section on the right-hand side of the opportunity.
3.	Click **Add co-owner**.
4.	Type in the co-owner’s name or email – the co-owner must have an Open Opportunities account. If they don’t have an account, their name will not appear.
5.	Click **Add**.

The co-owner will receive an email that they are now a co-owner of your opportunity. You can also make a co-owner the primary owner by clicking **Make primary** under their name.
