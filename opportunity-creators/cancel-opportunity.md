title: How to cancel an opportunity or internship
---
If you are an opportunity or internship creator or a sitewide or community administrator, you can cancel an opportunity or internship as long as it's not already complete. The status will change to **Canceled**, but you can reopen or duplicate it later. Canceled opportunities and internships will also continue to appear on the creators' dashboard.

To cancel an opportunity:
<hr>

1. Navigate to the opportunity detail page.
2. Scroll to the bottom right of the page.
3. Click **Cancel this opportunity**.
4. Click **Cancel opportunity**.

We will send an email to all applicants or participants letting them know the opportunity is canceled.

To cancel an internship:
<hr>

1. Navigate to the internship detail page.
2. Click **Cancel this internship** found beneath the status section.
3. Make a selection on the modal that is displayed.
4. Click the **Cancel internship** button.

We will send an email to all applicants or active participants letting them know the internship is canceled.
