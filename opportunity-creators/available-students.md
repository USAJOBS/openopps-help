title: How to select available students for internships 
---
If you did not have enough students apply for your internship, you can select and send out more offers using the **Available students** page.  This page will only appear if you are signed in, are an internship creator or co-owner and have created an internship in a cycle. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fX2UJjaaBY&t=21s" target="_blank">Watch this video on how to select a student from the available students page</a>. 

## What is the available students page? 

The **Available students** page displays all student candidates who are not actively participating in an internship for a given cycle.  Students will only display on this page if they submitted at least one application in the cycle and: 

* Did not accept an internship offer in the cycle.
* Did not respond to an internship offer they received.
* Did not receive an internship offer in the cycle. 

## How do I view available students? 

First, you can only select and send out more offers for internships that are **In-progress**.   

1. Use the **Available students** link in the top navigation or go to your internship detail page and select the **Find available students** button in the **Applicants** table.
2. Select an internship cycle from the internship cycle dropdown.
3. Use the **Keyword search**, **Sort by** and **Filters** to narrow the list of available students.
4. Click on a student’s name to view their most recent application. 

## How do I select available students? 

You can select a student for your internship from their most recent application page. 

1. Use the **Select student for** dropdown to choose which internship you want to offer to the student.
2. Click the **Select student** button—you will go to the mentor agreement page.
3. Read the **VSFS mentor agreement** and check the box to confirm you have read it and agree.
4. Click the **Select student and email** button. 

The student will receive an offer email and will have seven days to accept or decline the internship offer. 
We will remove the student from the **Available students** page and they will appear in the **Selected applicants** table of the internship they were selected for.
