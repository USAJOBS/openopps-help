title: What's the difference between a virtual and in-person opportunity?
---

## Participating in a virtual or in-person opportunity

A virtual opportunity means the work can be done remotely and you don’t need to travel. An in-person opportunity means you must do the work in-person at a specific location—usually the host office location. Some opportunities can be a combination of both.

## Creating a virtual or in-person opportunity

If you’re creating a new opportunity, you must select if the opportunity will be virtual, in-person, or both (you can select both options).

If you select virtual, you don’t need to provide additional information. If you select in-person or both options, you will need to include a location.

## Creating an in-person detail opportunity

If you’re creating a **detail opportunity** and you select in-person, you will need to include a location and **answer if the host office will pay for travel**—either yes, no, or negotiable. If you choose ‘negotiable’, the host office needs to work with the participant’s home office to agree on the travel pay.
