title: What does the type of commitment mean?
---

The commitment varies for each opportunity. Some opportunities are a ‘one-time’ deal, while others require a longer commitment.

The types of commitment are:

* [One-time](#one-time)
* [Detail](#detail)
* [Lateral](#lateral)

## One-time

A one-time opportunity is a smaller task that takes minimal time to complete and will happen only once.  The work may take a few hours to complete. For example: helping with a specific meeting, writing a paper, or creating a piece of marketing collateral. You stay in your current job and there is no money exchanged. 

### Time commitment example 

You may work about 2-4 hours on the project. 

### Benefits of a one-time opportunity

* As an opportunity creator, you receive extra help and insights from talent across the federal government.
* There’s no paperwork required (SF-182 is optional). 

## Detail

Detail opportunities can be part-time or full-time, and limited to a certain number of days. You work for someone else for an extended period.

A **part-time detail** lets you stay in your current job while taking on another job part-time. A **full-time detail** requires you to leave your current job and take on another job for a period of time.

If you’re creating a detail opportunity you must include instructions on how to apply and any additional requirements.

### What does it mean if a detail is reimbursable?

Some detail opportunities are reimbursable, meaning the host office (the place where a participant will perform the work) will pay the home office (the place where a participant is employed) for the participants’ time.

If a detail opportunity is not reimbursable, then the host office does not pay the home office. The home office will continue to pay the participant as they normally do (even while they are on the detail with the host office).

If the reimbursement is negotiable, the home and host offices must agree on payment.

### Time commitment example 

You may work 40 hours/week for 180 days. 

### Benefits of a detail opportunity

As an opportunity creator, you’ll receive program help in a part-time or full-time capacity. 

## Lateral

A lateral is a permanent move to a new position **in your current agency**, where you move to a new position at the same grade level as your previous position. Laterals offer a chance to gain new skills to help you move up in your career, or a chance to bring someone on that has skills they aren't using into a new job where they could use the skills.

In Open Opportunities, laterals are **only available within an agency community** and you can’t apply to a lateral outside of your agency.

If you’re creating a lateral opportunity you must include instructions on how to apply and any additional requirements.
