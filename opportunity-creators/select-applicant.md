If you created and posted an <a href="#How_to_select_an_opportunity_applicant">opportunity </a> or <a href="#How_to_select_an_internship_applicant">internship </a>, you’ll get an email every time someone applies. You can click the link in the email to see who has applied, or you can sign into Open Opportunities at any time to review applicants.

There are three different ways to review and select applicants, depending on the type of opportunity you posted: 

* <a href="#How_to_select_an_opportunity_applicant">How to review and select an applicant for an opportunity </a>
* <a href="#How_to_select_a_VSFS_internship_applicant">How to review and select an applicant for a Virtual Student Federal Service (VSFS) internship </a>
* <a href="#How_to_select_an_internship_applicant">How to review and select an applicant for a non-VSFS internship </a>
