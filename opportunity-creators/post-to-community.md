title: How to post to a community
---

A community is a group of Open Opportunity users who may belong to different agencies, but share a common goal or interest.

You can post an <a href="#To post an opportunity to a community">opportunity </a> or <a href="#To post an internship to a community">internship </a> to a specific community. When you post to a community, the opportunity or internship will appear on both the community search results and the main Open Opportunities search results. If you donâ€™t select a community, the opportunity or internship will appear to all users.
