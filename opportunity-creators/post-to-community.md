A community is a group of Open Opportunity users who may belong to different agencies, but share a common goal or interest.

You can post an opportunity or internship to a specific community. When you post to a community, the opportunity or internship will appear on both the community search results and the main Open Opportunities search results. If you donâ€™t select a community, the opportunity or internship will appear to all users.

1. Sign in to Open Opportunities.
2. Click **Create Opportunity** from the main search or landing page.
3. Select **Yes** to post the opportunity to a specific community.
4. Select the community from the dropdown.
