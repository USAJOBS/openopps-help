title: What are some examples of opportunities?
---

There are many types of opportunities you can post, depending on what you need or are looking to do, such as:

- Get help on projects.
- Propose working groups.
- Get testers for new ideas or products.
- Create a team to work on an idea you have.
- Share your expertise or best practices in a particular field.

Here are a few examples of past opportunities:

- Web design and development
- Content writing
- Data analysis
- Mentorships
- Video production and editing
- Platform testers
- Subject matter expert presenters
- Event volunteers

Once you are ready to create an opportunity, follow our [10 tips to create a successful opportunity post](../../getting-started/top-10-tips/). We encourage you to break up larger projects into multiple, smaller projects to reach a wider range of skillsets and make the work manageable.
