title: How to invite someone to apply to an opportunity
---

If you are an opportunity creator, you can invite people to apply to your opportunity using the **Networking** feature or from the list of people you saved in your opportunity. 

## Invite someone to apply using Networking

1. Sign in and click **Networking**.
2. Use the keyword or location search to find people you might be interested in.
3. Review the list of people and click **Invite**, located in the bottom right corner of each person’s card.
4. Select the opportunity you want to invite the person to—the dropdown will only display the opportunities you’ve created, and that the person is eligible to apply for. For example, you will not see an opportunity for a specific community, if the person you’re inviting is not a member of that community.
5. Click **Invite**.
6. Repeat these steps for each person you want to invite.

The person will get an email inviting them to apply to the opportunity. They will also see the invite on their dashboard (unless they’ve already applied or dismissed the invite).
You can also invite someone from your list of **Saved people** on your dashboard. Follow the same steps as above.

## Invite someone to apply from your opportunity

1. Sign in and go to your list of created opportunities.
2. Click the opportunity you want to invite people to.
3. Go to the **Applicants** section located on the right hand side of the opportunity page.
4. Click **Search for and invite more people to apply to your opportunity**—you’ll go the **Networking** page.
5. Follow the same steps for inviting someone through Networking.
