## Sitewide enhancements
### Sitewide events 

* Revised the success banner that displays after creating a sitewide event. The banner now includes the total number of events you can display.  

### Communities

* Removed a modal so it no longer displays when a user joins a community. 

### Other 

* Fixed an issue using parenthesis with skills engine—doing so will not stop a user from progressing through the **Create opportunity** process.  
* Updated the time format in multiple areas of the site to be consistent. 
* Worked on the future Student Marketplace feature—this will offer the ability to create and apply to unpaid internships (feature is not live yet).

## Bug fixes 

* Fixed an issue so non-federal users can't access an open community.
