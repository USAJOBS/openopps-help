### Sitewide enhancements
**Profile**

-	Added a notification banner for signed in users to update their profile skills and biography for use in skills matching.
-	Updated the skills section within the biography to a text box that includes formatting options instead of a select box.
-	Launched Skills Engine feature—when a user updates their **Skills** or **Biography** and clicks **Save**, their data is sent to Skills Engine and Skills Engine will assign and save related skills tags to the user’s profile behind the scenes.

**Create Opportunity**
-	Updated the Create opportunity process to 4-steps with a tracker at the top to show progress.
-	Updated help text for the **What you’ll do**, **What you’ll learn**, and **Requirements** fields, explaining that these fields will be used for skills matching. After clicking Next in step 2, the data for these fields will be sent to Skills Engine.
-	Moved **Skills** and **Related keywords** to a new step 3.
-	Updated Step 3 to display the relevant skills from Skills engine and other skills that are available.
-	Added ability for Opportunity creators to select up to 5 of the skills to add to their opportunity.

A future release will allow for us to suggest opportunities based on a user’s skills in their profile and the skills on an opportunity.
