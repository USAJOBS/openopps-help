## Site-wide enhancements

- Updated the application process for applying to details and laterals.
  - The application process includes a statement of interest, a resume selection field, and a sidebar with help text.
  - Opportunity creators can view the statement of interest, and resume when reviewing detail or lateral applications.
  - Applicants can update their applications while the detail or lateral opportunity is **Accepting applications**
- Updated how resumes are handled during the application process for a detail or lateral opportunity:
  - Applicants can upload resumes from USAJOBS.
  - Applicants and opportunity creators can download and view resumes that were uploaded through USAJOBS.
  - Applicants and opportunity creators can view resumes created from the USAJOBS resume builder tool.
- Created a confirmation page and **What happens next** page that displays when an applicant submits their application for a detail or lateral opportunity.
- Added a column called **Community** to the manage opportunities page so that sitewide administrators know which opportunities are part of a community.
- Added the community name under the agency name to display on the opportunity preview and overview page.
