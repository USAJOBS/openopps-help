## Sitewide enhancements
We made several changes to the dashboard for sitewide, community managers, and agency administrators, including:

* Updated the dashboard counts on agency and administrator pages to have a consistent look and feel.
* Created separate tabs for sitewide and agency administratorâ€™s views, preferences, and settings.
* Added the ability to publish an opportunity from the opportunity page.
* Updated the status dates on opportunities to increase clarity for sitewide and agency administrators.
* Updated the **Testimonial** stories page.
* Added a back button on the homepage to improve navigation and workflow.

## Bug Fixes

* Removed office and bureau data when removing an opportunity from a community.
* Removed an old help link from the profile page.
