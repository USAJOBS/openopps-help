## Sitewide enhancements

* Added the ability for an administrator to unlink an Open Opportunities account from USAJOBS.
* Added an alert for new users if they’re missing profile information when they first use the site.
* Added a new section to the user profile page to display any opportunities that a user has created.   

### Communities

* Updated communities so when a user creates a new community event, it will display within the community by default. 

### Other

* Made several changes to support the future Internship opportunity feature.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed a modal display issue so it no longer displays after an active session expires.
* Fixed a display issue with the **Networking** tab so it shows the ‘underline’ which indicates what page the user is on.
* Fixed a broken link on the dashboard page to go to the correct help center page.
* Fixed the **Virtual location** filter to show opportunities that are virtual in the search results.
* Fixed the **Sort by** filter on an active saved search so it displays archived saved searches.
* Fixed the pagination function on the **Networking** page.
* Updated the sitewide event card to correctly display the event date.
