## Sitewide enhancements
### Authentication

* Created a new modal that will display when a user updates their profile to no longer be a current federal employee or federal contractor. The modal will tell them theyâ€™re no longer eligible to use Open Opportunities.

### Endorsements

* Updated the **Profile dashboard** so a participant can see their endorsements and who endorsed them. Participants can also choose if they want others to see their endorsements.
* Updated the **Task completed email** to include any endorsements.

### Messaging

* Added a **Messages** area where users can view and manage their email messages from Open Opportunities.  Users can:
  * Flag messages as read and unread.
  * Sort messages by newest or oldest.
  * Filter messages by read or unread.
  * Delete messages.
